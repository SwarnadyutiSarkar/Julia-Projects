# For environmental data analysis, you can use packages like ArchGDAL.jl for reading geospatial data and Plots.jl for visualization.

using ArchGDAL
using Plots

# Read environmental data (e.g., satellite imagery, climate data)
filename = "environmental_data.tif"  # Replace with your data file path
dataset = ArchGDAL.read(filename)
image_data = ArchGDAL.read(dataset, 1)  # Read the first band (assuming it's a single-band image)

# Display the environmental data
heatmap(image_data, c=:viridis, xlabel="X", ylabel="Y", title="Environmental Data")
