# For health monitoring and wearable devices, you can use packages like Flux.jl for machine learning models, and Plots.jl for visualization.

using Flux
using Plots

# Simulate wearable device data (e.g., heart rate)
# Example: Generate synthetic heart rate data for 24 hours at 1-minute intervals
time_points = collect(0:60:24*60)  # Time points in minutes
heart_rate_data = 60 .+ 10*sin.(2Ï€*time_points/1440)  # Simulated heart rate data (sinusoidal variation)

# Visualize heart rate data
plot(time_points, heart_rate_data, xlabel="Time (minutes)", ylabel="Heart Rate (bpm)", label="Heart Rate", legend=:topright)
